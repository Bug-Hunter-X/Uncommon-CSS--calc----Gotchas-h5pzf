The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a container might not subtract the 10px if the container's width is determined by its content, instead of a fixed value. Another issue can be with unit mixing, you can't mix percentages and pixels directly without parentheses like `width: 100% - 10px` which will result in error. Also, be aware of operator precedence; ensure calculations are grouped correctly using parentheses to avoid unexpected results. Finally, browser compatibility should always be considered; some older browsers might not support the latest `calc()` functionalities.
